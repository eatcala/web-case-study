# web-case-study

This repository is a boiler plate based on our backoffice architecture, our backoffice is built with React 16. Code is linted using ESlint with the Airbnb ruleset and Prettier. We don't use Redux or any other state management library but React hooks and Apollo state with React Router for the routing.

**Requirements:**
